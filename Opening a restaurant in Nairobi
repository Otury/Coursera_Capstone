1.1 Introduction
Kenya is the world's 48th largest country by total area with a population of more than 47.6 million people as per Kenya population census 2019. Kenya is the 29th most populous country. As of 2019, Kenya had an estimated GDP of US$99.246 billion and per capita GDP of US$2,010 making it the 62nd largest economy in the world. 
The economy of Kenya is a market-based economy with a liberalised external trade system. One of the key economic sectors is tourism and contributes about 63 percent of GDP. This sector exhibited steady growth becoming the country's principal source of foreign exchange;
Nairobi, Kenya’s capital city, is the country’s economic core. The city has a population of just over 4  million as per the population census of 2019 spread across 696 square kilometres (269 square miles). Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes area, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. Nairobi’s area size - in combination with the total number of residents - brings  the current population density which is now approximately 4,850 residents per square kilometer. (12,600 people living per square mile)  
The food and beverage industry is a segment of the entire tourism industry. The restaurant business in Kenya has been growing rapidly over the last couple of years. Evidence of this is seen by the expansion of major food chains in Kenya. Nairobi is referred to as the region’s foodie hub. One may argue that this is due to a rise in disposable incomes, fast economic growth and a young population. The young population largely characterized by millennials means it’s just not enough to start and run a restaurant “serving meals on a basic white plate”. The market demands includes but not limited to creativity from open kitchens, more wood-less industry, craft beers,  and fusion foods 
In Nairobi, a report highlights, the total spend in restaurants- and eating out more broadly – is anticipated to rise by 77 percent from US$848 million (Sh87.4 billion) in 2017 to US$1.5 billion (Sh154.7 billion) over the next decade. Additionally, restaurant location is a very important factor in customer perception. Restaurants in affluent neighborhoods are generally perceived to offer superior service and customer experience


1.2 Statement of the problem
The demography of Nairobi is interesting to the average entrepreneur or restaurateur. Restaurant segment of the  hospitality industry is influenced greatly by the availability of leisure time and disposable income. In this business segment it is all about location-location-location! This is a key factor in its potential for success. Prime location gives any establishment a competitive advantage. A restaurateur would have to consider a location that has constant and predictable foot-traffic in conjunction with the physical amenities that supports the foot-traffic. An entrepreneur or restaurateur hoping to open a restaurant in the Nairobi area has to consider market demand,  clarity of market segmentation they would like to service and the niche they would participate in or occupy. 
Whereas Nairobi is described as the region's foodie hub fuelled by key demographic characteristics previously described, Nairobi’s signature niche is not obvious. If a restaurateur wanted to open a new restaurant in the city based on category-popularity, which category of restaurant would they open? 

1.3 Objectives
For purposes of the Applied Data Science Capstone project, I will look at the possibility of opening a new restaurant in Nairobi city with the primary consideration being the niche of the restaurant. I will use a descriptive approach to narrate the data because I will be able to define and describe the observations. The population will be derived from Foursquare API to get the most common category in the city.
There is limited published public-data on restaurants in Nairobi. Since location is an important determinant, I will attempt to link the commercial space pricing with regard to location. I will therefore collect data on average commercial space pricing in different parts of Nairobi and attempt to link this to the popularity of venues.

1.4 Significance of the study 
The beneficiaries of the study stretch the length and breadth of the entire participants in the industry. These include;
The government would benefit from this information in informing the regulatory framework from zonal classifications to public health and safety legislation.
Restaurateurs would benefit from this information as they would be able to identify popular  niches which these popular venues service.
Scholars too would benefit from the conclusions drawn herein as I will highlight categorization of restaurants and other scholars would attempt to find the nexus with any other emerging dependent variable.

1.5 Scope of study
This study will be carried out in Nairobi city and will target licensed restaurants.

1.6 Methodology
I will GitHub repository, which will have the following components:  Nairobi city with corresponding latitude and longitude information
I will use the python folium library to visualize geographic details of the city, five thousand meters radius from the centre of the city. I used latitude and longitude values to get the visual as below
I will utilize the Foursquare API to explore five thousand meters radius from the centre of the city and perform some segmentation. I designed the limit as one thousand venues and the radius five thousand meters given latitude and longitude information.
